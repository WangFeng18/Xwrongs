*args, I think it can be regraded as a symbol that can disentangle a list into a list of number, that is *[1,2,3] is equal to
(in some aspect) 1,2,3 so if you want to pass the parameters using a list, just add a * before the variable.
In the reverse, you can use variable as a list without star inside the function.
