#####remote: Permission to WangFeng18/S.git denied to GitGroot.
I fixed it by changing the origin address from https://github.com/WangFeng18/S.git/ to 
                                               https://WangFeng18@github.com/WangFeng18/S.git
which was added a username@ before github.com
Because I clone the repository of my github,Maybe the address is different?I don't know how it works.
Modify the origin address in .git/config
